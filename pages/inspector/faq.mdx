# FAQ

### Do I need to replace my existing tracking code?

### Do I need to add Avo to my privacy policy?

No, you don’t! Avo doesn’t collect any user data. We only collect metadata about your user data. Read more on what kind of data Avo collects in **What kind of data does Avo collect?** below.

### What kind of data does Avo collect?

Avo doesn’t collect any user data. We only collect metadata about your user data. So what does that mean?
Let’s take an example. If you are sending the following event from your app:

**Checkout Completed** <br />
User Id: 1337 <br />
Email Address: “jane.doe@avo.app” <br />
Product Id: 45 <br />
Revenue: 15.99

our SDK will analyze that and store it as:

**Checkout Completed** <br />
User Id: int <br />
Email Address: string <br />
Product Id: int <br />
Revenue: float

Avo doesn’t need to know the actual values, we only need to understand the shape of the data.

### What does Avo do with my data?

### Does Avo batch events in the SDK?

The Avo Inspector SDKs does batch events before sending metadata about them to Avo’s servers. The details of the batching may vary between platforms, <Link to="/inspector/sdk">read more in the docs for the SDKs</Link>.
