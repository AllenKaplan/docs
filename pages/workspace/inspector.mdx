The inspector tab is where you configure your inspector sources, get API keys to send data form the clients, set up slack alerts and examine the issues that Inspector found.

### Default view and switching between views

If you have no sources set up you will thee the <Link passHref href="./inspector#manage-sources"><a>Sources screen</a></Link> as the default view of the Inspector Tab.
If you already have set up a source you would see the <Link passHref href="./inspector#view-events"><a>Events screen</a></Link>.
Use the button in the top left corner to switch between the Sources and the Events screens.

## Manage Sources

### Issue alerts

Here you can connect Inspector to your Slack to receive a notification when new issues appear.

Press the `Connect to Slack` button and follow the instructions.

Avo Inspector will post new issues it finds in production hourly to the specified slack channel.

## View Events

### Header filters

Here you can choose which environment to examine, the time window and search for event name.

#### Environments

Currently Inspector supports 3 types of environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

The events are streamed to the Environment specified in the client, based on the environment constant provided when initializing the Avo Inspector SDK.

> Development and Staging events appear in the dashboard in a few minutes after they are fired and Production events can take up to 2 hours.

#### Time window

Currently Inspector supports 4 types of time windows:

- 1 hour
- 24 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days

All the time windows are updated hourly on Production and are close to real time in Development and Staging.

#### Search for event name

Type the vent name in the input field and only events with similar name will be shown.

If you want an exact match put the event name in quotes, i.e. "App Opened".

### Share current view of Inspector

Notice that after you change the header filters the URL also changes. You can share this URL with a collegue and they would see exactly the same slice of inspector data as you filtered.

### Events list

The main part of the View Events screen is the list of all events seen, after the specified filters are applied.

You can expand the events to see the event properties.

If Inspector sees an event that is not yet in your tracking plan there is a shortcut to add it to your Tracking plan.

If Inspector detects an issue it will indicate that in the list.

If you select an event or property row a panel with detailed information will appear on the right. There you would be able to see extended information about the issues and edit the event or property in your tracking plan.

##### <a name="missing-usual-property-in-event"></a>Property sometimes missing

Detects absence of event properties across tracking calls.

_**Example:** Property onboarding status is not sent with 30% of the App Opened event._

##### <a name="event-property-type-inconsistency"></a>Property type mismatch

Detects type changes of event properties across tracking calls.

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property onboarding status on event App Opened: int (84%), string (16%)._

##### <a name="event-is-not-present-on-some-platforms"></a>Event missing on some platforms (coming soon)

Detects events sent by one platform, but not sent by another. Can be a sign of missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS sends App Opened event, but Android does not._

##### <a name="property-missing-on-some-platforms"></a>Property missing on some platforms (coming soon)

Detects properties sent by one platform, but not sent by another.

_**Example:** iOS sends user id with the App Opened event, but Android does not._

##### <a name="event-volume-change-between-versions"></a>Event volume change significant between versions (coming soon)

Detects significant changes in event volume between app versions.

_**Example:** Volume of event App Opened drop by 25% between versions v1.3.2 and v1.3.3 on iOS_

##### <a name="significant-volume-mismatch-between-platforms"></a>Event volume significantly different between platforms (coming soon)

Detects events sent way more frequently by one platform versus another adjusted for sessions number. Can be a sign of duplicated or missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS is sending 10x more volume per session than Android of the App Opened event._

##### <a name="event-name-casing"></a>Event name casing (coming soon)

Detects event names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** Event open_app is snake case, expected title case (Open App)._

##### <a name="property-name-casing"></a>Property name casing (coming soon)

Detects property names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** The property onboarding_status on event App Opened is snake_case, expected camel case (onboardingStatus)._

##### <a name="global-property-type-inconsistency"></a>Global property type mismatch (coming soon)

Detects properties with identical names and different types across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property revenue on events Purchase Completed: int and Checkout Completed: string._

#### Smart Issues (coming soon)

- <a href="#similar-event-names">Similar event names</a>
- <a href="#event-similar-property-names">
    Similar property names within event
  </a>
- <a href="#property-expected-type-mismatch">
    Unexpected type based on property name
  </a>
- <a href="#global-similar-property-names">Global similar property names</a>
- <a href="#missing-usual-property-in-similar-events">
    Missing property based on property group pattern
  </a>

##### <a name="similar-event-names"></a>Similar event names

Detects similar event names, that can point to duplicate tracking.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple events describing the same user action: App Opened, App Open, open_app + 2 more events._

##### <a name="event-similar-property-names"></a>Similar property names within event

Detects similar property names in a single event.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

##### <a name="property-expected-type-mismatch"></a>Unexpected type based on property name

Detects when a property name that is often associated with a specific type has some other type.

_**Example:** Revenue property is string type (expected to be a number)._

##### <a name="global-similar-property-names"></a>Global similar property names (low)

Detects similar property names across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

##### <a name="missing-usual-property-in-similar-events"></a>Missing property based on property group pattern

Detects missing property in a group of similarly looking properties.

_**Example:** Property onboarding_status is sent with 4 out of 5 events of the Onboarding events group._
