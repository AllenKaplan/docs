You will recognise the issue reporter by the yellow exclamation point next to the Tracking Plan item in the sidebar. Itâ€™s meant to help teams follow their naming convention and surface issues like when a type is missing from a property.

Below is an overview of the reported issues and how you can resolve them (\* issues marked with a star can only occur after importing a tracking plan into your workspace).

- **Conflicting properties\***
  - What it means: There are more than one definition of a property with the same name
  - How to resolve: Aligning the descriptions, types and property constraints of the conflicting properties and fix the implementation of those that don't fit your standards
- **Events with same or similar names\***
  - What it means: Two or more events have same or similar names, meaning that the words are the same but the casing is different
  - How to resolve: Pick the casing that matches the one that is dominant one in your workspace and fix the implementation of those that don't fit your standards
- **Event names not in your dominant casing**
  - What it means: Some of your events are not named according to the dominant casing in your workspace
  - How to resolve: Fix the names and implementation of the events that don't fit your standards.Note that this will only be fixed for the data going forward, not historical data
- **Properties with same or similar names\***
  - What it means: Two or more properties have same or similar names, meaning that the words are the same but the casing is different
  - How to resolve: Pick the casing that matches the one that is dominant one in your workspace and fix the implementation of those that don't fit your standards
- **Property names not in your dominant casing**
  - What it means: Some of your properties are not named according to the dominant casing in your workspace
  - How to resolve: Fix the names and implementation of the properties that don't fit your standards.Note that this will only be fixed for the data going forward, not historical data
- **Properties don't have a defined type**
  - What it means: Some of your properties are defined as any
  - How to resolve: Assign the intended type for the property and make sure that the implementation matches the assigned type
