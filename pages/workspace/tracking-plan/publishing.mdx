Publishing is where you can configure Avo to publish your Tracking Plan to your analytics platform, a production time validation tool or your own custom endpoint via webhook.

Available integrations are:

- <a href="#segment-protocols">Segment Protocols</a>
- <a href="#mixpanel-lexicon">Mixpanel Lexicon</a>
- <a href="#rudderstack">RudderStack</a>
- <a href="#amplitude-govern">Amplitude Govern</a>
- <a href="#mparticle">mParticle Data Master</a>
- <a href="#webhook">Webhook</a>

Publishing enables your Tracking Plan to be:

- Published whenever a branch is merged with Auto Publishing
- Published with a push of a button
- Downloaded from your Avo workspace on relevant format

## Setting up and configuring a publishing integration

### Create a new publishing integration

To create a new publishing integration, find the Publishing part of the tracking plan in the left side navigation bar. From there you can click the "Add Integration" button to create a new publishing integration.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../../images/workspace/nav-publishing.png')}
    width="100%"
    alt="Creating a new Publishing Integration"
  />
</center>

Then you can select the type of integration you want to create and give it a name.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../../images/workspace/integrations/create-integration.png')}
    width="75%"
    alt="Creating a new Publishing Integration"
  />
</center>

Note that the publishing integrations are independent of the destinations defined in the "Sources" tab. However the publishing integration can use those destinations to filter which events should be included in the publishing integration. See more below in <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/publishing#filtering-events-for-publishing"><a>Filtering events for publishing</a></Link>.

### Configure Auto publishing

When Auto Publishing is enabled all changes made on a branch will be published to the integration when the branch is merged.

    width="100%"
    alt="Publishing filter to publish only events sent from Web to Amplitude"
  />
</center>

### Filtering events for publishing

You can customize which events in Avo are published to which integrations by using the events filter. Events can be filtered by Sources, Destinations and Tags. For example the following integration will only publish events sent from Web to Amplitude.

  <img
    src={require('../../../images/publish_filter.png')}
    width="100%"
    alt="Publishing filter to publish only events sent from Web to Amplitude"
  />
</center>

#### Filtering and source specific property presence

How is source specific property presence published?

- If you don't filter the integration by any source, the property presence is set to the "lowest common denominator" for all sources the property is sent from
- If you filter the integration with one source, the property presence is set to the presence configured for that source on the property
- If you filter by more than one source, the property presence is set to the "lowest common denominator" for the sources you're filtering by and are sending the property

What does the "lowest common denominator" mean?

- If the property is "Always sent" on all sources being published, the property presence is set to "Always sent" (required)
- If the property is "Sometimes sent" on one or more sources being published, the property presence is set to "Sometimes sent" (optional)
- If property is "Never sent" on all sources being published, the property is not included in the publishing

### Configure the mParticle integration

To enable the direct integration with mParticle Data Master, you need to configure it with the following parameters from mParticle.

- **mParticle Client ID**: Your client ID issued by mParticle. To get both Client ID and Client Secret press the person icon in the bottom left of your mParticle web UI. Then click "Settings" -> "API Credentials" and create new credentials. You'll get both Client ID and Client Secret there.
- **mParticle Client Secret**: Your client secret issued by mParticle.
- **mParticle Workspace ID**: The ID of the workspace containing your data plans. To find it click the app name in the top left of the mParticle web UI, then "Settings". You'll see the list of your workspaces, Workspace ID is the number below your workspace name.
- **mParticle Plan ID**: The ID of the Data Plan to update. To view available plans press "Data Master" -> "Plans" in the navigation panel in the mParticle UI. You'll see the list of your plans. Plan ID is the string below the plan name.

### Publishing to mParticle

Avo will create a new version of your data plan in mParticle every time you publish. When publishing manually you can pick whether you'd like to overwrite existing mParticle data plan version or create a new one. Auto publish will always create a new version of the data plan in mParticle, by incrementing the version number of the most recent plan by one.

Avo will override all events in the mParticle Tracking Plan that are being imported from Avo. Any changes made to an event in an mParticle Tracking Plan between publishing from Avo will be overridden on the next Avo publish.

Avo will not override any events that are only defined in mParticle, or events that have not been excluded from the mParticle integration in Avo with filters.

<img
  src={require('../../../images/publishing_govern.svg')}
  alt="Amplitude"

### Publishing to Govern

To publish your Avo tracking plan to Govern, click the "Publish to Govern" button in the integration interface, or enable Auto Publishing to publish the Tracking Plan whenever a branch has been merged.

#### What Is Included In The Publish to Govern?

On publish, Avo will merge your Avo tracking plan with any existing events in Govern. Any changes made to an event in Govern between Avo publish will be overridden on next Avo publish.

Avo will not impact any events or properties that are not defined in Avo, or events that have not been added to the Govern integration in Avo. Avo will not impact any custom events defined in Govern.

Here's how events, properties and categories are mapped from Avo to Govern:
##### Event
- **Event type**: The event name as defined in Avo. If <Link passHref href="/data-design/name-mapping"><a>name mapping</a></Link> is applied to the event for an Amplitude destination, the name defined by the name mapping is used here.
- **Category**: Amplitude Govern only supports one category per event, so the first category attached to the event in Avo is used here
- **Description**: This is the description as provided in Avo
  - Coming Soon: We're currently working on including the event triggers here as well

##### Event Property
- **Event property**: The property name as defined in Avo. If <Link passHref href="/data-design/name-mapping"><a>name mapping</a></Link> is applied to the property for an Amplitude destination, the name defined by the name mapping is used here.
- **Event type**: The name of the event this property is attached to. If the property is attached to multiple events in Avo, multiple properties will be created in Govern because Govern does not support reusing properties across multiple events with a <Link passHref href="/data-design/global-namespacesharing"><a>global namespace</a></Link>.
- **Type**: The property type in Avo mapped to one of Govern's supported property types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `enum` or `any`
- **Is array**: `true` if the "list" checkbox is checked on the property in Avo
- **Is required**: `true` if the property is marked as "Always sent" in Avo
- **Description**: The property description as defined in Avo
- **Enum values**: If the property is of type string, and the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/properties#a-nameproperty-enumsa-enumeration-of-allowed-string-values"><a>"property matches..." rule</a></Link> is applied in Avo, the allowed values are provided here
##### Category
- **Name**: The name of the category as defined in Avo. If the category already exists in Govern, we reuse that one.


### Govern Publishing Warnings

- **409 Conflict**: Some events that are in your Govern Schema are not recognized by the Govern API, for example events that have been merged into other events in Govern or events that are blocked.
Events that end up returning 409 error in Amplitude are likely not active. If you'd like to get rid of this warning please double check them and remove them from your Avo tracking plan if they are not active anymore.

### Govern Publishing Errors

The following errors might occur when publishing your tracking to Govern. When publishing errors occur the error message in the Avo UI will contain which items could not be updated along with the error codes.

- **404 Not Found**: We tried to update an event that doesn't exist in your Amplitude Govern Schema. If this error occurs for all of the events you are attempting to publish it might indicate that your Amplitude Govern Schema has not been initialized. Learn more about initializing your Amplitude Govern Schema in [the Amplitude Govern docs](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047579451-Initialize-and-manage-the-Schema).
After you Govern Schema is initialized usually the API continues to return occasional 404 errors for a few more hours. If your Govern Schema has been initialized more than 6 hours ago and the error persists, please contact support.

- **408 Timeout**: The publishing operation took too long. This can happen when publishing large tracking plans for the first time. Click publish again to resume the publish, it will continue from where it left off.

- **409 Conflict**: We tried to update an item that doesn't exist in your Amplitude Govern Schema.
We noticed that this error may happen if the entity has a non-default state in your Govern schema, i.e. it is marked as "Unexpected" or "Blocked". Try setting the state to "Expected" in Govern and unblock erroring entities and publish again.
If that does not help this might be caused by an internal error. Please reach out to support so we can help you resolve the issue.

- **429 Too Many Requests**: We've exceeded the number of Govern requests we can make per hour for the provided API credentials or there are too many concurrent requests to the Amplitude Govern API with given credentials.
Please wait before trying to publish again and make sure that you are not running multiple publishing at the same time for the same credentials. You can learn more about Amplitude Govern request limits [in the Amplitude Govern docs](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016606991-Taxonomy-API#h_53f1b7d4-ee8d-4a81-945b-e5a2909ddfad).

- **Other error codes**: Please contact us if you are experiencing other types of errors.


<img

  alt="Webhook"
  style={{ margin: '32px 0 -32px 0' }}
/>

## <a name="webhook"></a> Webhook

The Webhook integration is a way to get your updated Tracking Plan distributed to an endpoint of your choice. This happens when a branch is merged or when the publish button is clicked in the integration interface.

### Configure the Webhook integration

To enable the Webhook integration you need to configure it with a URL where you want the updated tracking plan to be delivered.

The Tracking Plan will be delivered with a `POST` request containing the Tracking Plan on a JSON format. The only requirement for this endpoint is to return a `200` response status code when it has successfully received the tracking plan.

### Tracking Plan Model

> 💡 To see your exact Webhook payload in your Avo workspace choose `Tracking plan` - `Publishing` in the sidebar, then pick your Webhook from the menu and expand the `Payload preview` section
