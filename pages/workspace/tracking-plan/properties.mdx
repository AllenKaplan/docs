Properties are also known as traits, attributes, metadata, etc. They are information that is attached to events, that describe the state of the user or the product at the time of the event. Avo allows you to define event, user and system properties - each category described below.

### <a name="event-properties"></a> Event properties

Event properties describe the current state of your product at the time of the
event.

**Example**

For example the property "Game Mode" on the event "Game Started", is
relevant for that specific event, when you analyse your data. You might be want to correlate the completion rate of the game with the Game Mode, to decide how valuable the Game Modes are.

**Functionality**

Event properties are sent with the event in the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/events#a-namelog-eventa-log-event"><a>event call</a></Link>.

### <a name="user-properties"></a> User Properties

User properties to describe the state of your user. It is information that is
usually relevant in a larger scope than for exactly that event.

**Example**

For example, you might want to correlate the Total Games Played of your users with how likely
they are to recommend your product to their friend, to make sure you ask them to
do that at the right time.

Some User Properties change rarely, such as "Email",
which mostly changes on Signup. And many analytics platforms support you in
analysing all of your data by your user properties, while only sending them
along with your events when they actually change.

**Functionality**

User properties are updated with the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/events#a-nameupdate-user-propsa-update-user-properties"><a>Update User Properties action</a></Link>.

### <a name="system-properties"></a> System properties

System properties represent information that's relevant for all events that you send, and yet
do not describe the state of the user.

**Example**

For example, the user could alter between mobile and web platforms, so you would not necessarily have "Platform" be a user property that
gets overwritten each time the user switches platforms. Instead you could set
"Platform" to be a System Property in Avo, which are properties that we send
along with all events, as event properties for you. The values for such a property could be "Web App", "Desktop App", "iOS
App", "Android App", etc.

**Functionality**

System properties are set in the Avo.initAvo() function. They can be updated with `Avo.setSystemProperties()` if needed, but otherwise the values persist during the lifecycle of the application.

### <a name="property-groups"></a> Property groups

Property groups are a way to group two or more related properties to quickly and consistently add them to all related events.

An e-commerce website might want to attach all product properties to cart and checkout events.
An example property group could be "Product" containing the following properties:

- Product ID
- Product Name
- Product Price
- Product Quantity

### <a name="property-types-and-constraints"></a> Property types and constraints

In the property modal for event, user and system properties you need to define the type of the values allowed for the property. That definition is used to validate the property.

Avo supports properties with values of the following types and constraints:

- string _(enumeration of allowed values)_
- integer _(minimum and maximum value)_
- float _(minimum and maximum value)_
- boolean _(true or false)_

Properties values can also be a list of the above mentioned types:

- [‘foo’, ‘bar’’]
- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- [1.2, 1.3, 1.6]
- [true, false, true, true, false]

### <a name="property-presence-configuration"></a> Configuring when Properties are required or optional

You can configure when Properties are required on a per-event and per-source basis. That means Avo will not give you an error if that property is missing from an event or source which the property is attached to, in other words it will sometimes be sent.

For per-event granularity you can choose between _Sometimes Sent_ or _Always Sent_.

For configuring per-event and per-source you can change the overall setting for the property to _Depending on Source_, revealing the sources available for each event for even more granular control.
