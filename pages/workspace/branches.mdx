## What are branches?

Avo offers branched workflows similar to git, to enable seamless collaboration between and within teams in your company. That means when you are making changes to your tracking plan, you can do it on a branch such that you can play around with your changes without affecting the source of truth on the main branch.

We highly recommend always creating a branch first before making changes to the tracking plan, no matter how small the changes are â€“ in particular if the changes made require implementation. If changes are made directly on the main branch, then you risk someone else creating a branch that include your incomplete changes, which will very likely lead to conflicts in the future.

## How to create branches

To create a new branch, first make sure you are on the main branch. Then click the icon with the plus sign next to where it says `master`.

  />
</center>

## How should branches be structured?

We recommend setting up branches that have isolated changes that can be opened, implemented and merged within a few days. Typically there's a one to one mapping between Avo branches and git branches.

Like in git, we recommend against creating big branches with a backlog of events and properties to be implemented. We'd rather recommend splitting them in to manageable chunks that will be implemented together in a single git branch.

## Protected main branch 

To make sure no one accidentally makes changes directly on the main brand and encourage peer review, you can opt in to protecting the main branch. That means:
- Only admins can make changes directly on the main branch
- Only admins can merge branches that haven't been approved by a collaborator

To enable this configuration, click the settings wheel in your workspace, go into members and permissions and check "Protected Main Branch" in the permissions tab.
