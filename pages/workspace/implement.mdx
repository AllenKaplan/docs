The implement tab provides detailed instructions per source - on how to get the Avo file, Initialize Avo and implement events. It also provides an overview of how many events that are attached to each source have been seen valid in development.

## <a name="source-overview"></a> Source Overview

On the left side of the Implement tab is a list of sources with how many of the events have been seen in development. I a source in the list is marked with "Not setup", it is likely that either the development or production API is missing from the source. The source needs to set up properly with both production and development API keys to access the documentation for that source.

## <a name="avo-file"></a> Get the Avo file

The Avo file can be thought of as an utility file for your analytics. It should be placed somewhere in your source code directory and checked into git. The Avo file is code generated based on your Avo workspace, with a function per each event that validates the properties before passing the event forward to your analytics SDK. So every time the tracking plan in Avo is updated, the Avo file has to be updated.

There are two methods available to get the Avo file:

1. Copy or download it form the Implement tab
2. Download it through the Avo CLI, by running `avo pull`

## <a name="init-avo"></a> Initalize Avo

Before you can use the library to log events and do other actions, you must call the initAvo function. We recommend doing this as early as possible in your app lifecycle. More detailed instructions on how to initialize Avo can be found in th implement tab.

## <a name="implement-actions"></a> Implement Events

For every source in the implement tab there is documentation on how to implement each action attached to that source:

When the event has been seen valid in development, a green checkmark appears by the event name:
