Avo is equipped with a familiar user interface to define and maintain Group Types and their properties. Read more about Groups <Link passHref href="data-design/groups"><a>here</a></Link>.

## Creating Group Types

You can create Group Types either from the Properties screen or from the `Update Groups` action from the Event details.

* From the Properties screen click `+ Add Group Type`
* From the Update Groups action click `+ Add Group Type`

and fill in name and description of your Group Type.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Each Group Type will need an ID for association (e.g. `Workspace` : `Avo`). If you would like to strictly define possible ids for a type (e.g. `Role` : [one of `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`, etc.] you can choose `Property Id should match one of` and define your possibilities.

## Creating Group Properties

Group Properties are properties which belong to a specific group type (e.g. Member Count for Group Type Workspace). There are also two ways to create Group Properties

* From the Properties screen, find the Group Properties section and your Group Type's subsection and click `+ Add Group Property`
* From the Update Groups action choose the Group Type and then `+ Add Group Property`

and fill in name and description of your Group Property.

Groups and Group Properties should then be available from the `Update Groups` action.
