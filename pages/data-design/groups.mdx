## Groups

Groups are used to link individual users or events with a group or account.

### Linking users to groups

Often users belong to a group for a long period of time and all their actions should be automatically assigned to that group.
In that case it makes sense to link that user to a group.

The most common use cases include keeping track of a company, organization, account, project or a team using your product.

### Linking events to groups

In other cases, when users not permanently belong to a group, it might make sense to only link certain events to groups.

Examples of this case include: playlists in a music app, broadcast channels in messaging apps or a dashboard in analytics software.

### Why use Groups

Using Group properties in analytics destinations like Segment, Mixpanel and Amplitude,
will allow you to for example calculate Group retention or Group conversion rates,
where if one user in the group fulfills the return or conversion criteria, the entire Group is counted towards returned or converted groups.

## Group properties

You can assign properties to your groups. They work similar to User properties, but on each group level.

For example, at Avo we use "Workspace" groups, and each workspace can have the following properties:

```json
{
  "name": "QuizUp",
  "industry": "Social Gaming",
  "plan": "Enterprise",
  "seats": "99"
}
```
