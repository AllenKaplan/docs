**Pinned Properties** is a way to make specific property be sent with the same constant value all the time.

## How to use property pinning

Use property pinning to assing constant value to a property. When the value of a property is pinned it will always be sent as the pinned value. 

Developers won't be required to pass in value for the property when the event is being sent, the value will be hardcoded in the generated code.

You can pin event and user properties on the event level, i.e. set that a particular property will have the same value every time it's sent with a particular event.

## Pinning a property value on an event

To pin a value for a property on a specific event 

1. Proceed to the tracking plan events in your Avo workspace 
2. Pick an event where you'd like to pin a property value
3. Locate the event or user property and pless the â‹®
4. Pick the "Pin  Property Value" option
5. Set the constant value of the property

# Use cases

One of the main use cases is the hardcoded metadata for events. For example when using Snowplow destination you are required to attach a schema id to every event. This is done with the pinned properties in Avo.
