## Commenting

All the individual items in your Avo Tracking plan can be commented on.

You can comment on events, properites, metrics, integration and many more!

<center>
  <img src={require('../../images/comment.png')} alt="Comment input" />
</center>
<center>
  <i>Look for comment input fields like this one</i>
</center>
<br />

Note that your comments live on the branch you are on when making the comment. Then, when the branhc is merged, they become available on the merge target branch.

### Commenting during branch review

When reviewing a branch comments are brought to the highlight on the `Review` screen.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/branch-review-item.png')}
    alt="Branch review item"
  />
</center>
<center>
  <i>Press the button on the right to add a comment</i>
</center>
<br />

### Collaborating in comments

Avo has a concept called collaborators. All collaborators of the item on which the comment is made will get notifications about that comment.

You can add someone as collaborator to any item by @-mentioning that person.

You can also use `Edit Collaborators` button to add or remove collaborators.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/edit-collaborators-ui.png')}
    alt="Edit collaborators UI"
  />
</center>
<center>
  <i>
    You can edit the list of collaborators after pressing the Edit Collaborators
    button
  </i>
</center>
<br />

Notice that when you @-mention someone they will automatically appear in the collaborators list.
