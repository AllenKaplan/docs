title: 'Multiple sources on Avo branches'
---

For teams that have more than one platform, it often occurs that changes are made to the tracking plan for more than one Avo source at the same time.

We recommend creating one Avo branch that includes changes for all desired sources. For the sources that will not be implemented for now, deselect "Implement with Avo"  on the sources that are not ready. Then you can merge the branch and create new ones for the remaining sources, or perhaps a branch per source.

So the step by step guide would be:
1. Create a branch
2. Create your events and add all sources that should send the event
3. Uncheck "Implement with Avo" for all the sources that should not be implemented on this branc
4. Implement events that have "Implement with Avo" checked
5. Merge the branch
6. Create new branches for the remaining sources
7. Check implement with Avo on the source that should be implemented on the new branch
8. Implement the new branch
9. Merge the new branch
