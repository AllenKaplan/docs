Avo is equipped with a familiar user interface to define and maintain Group Types
and their properties and updating Group Properties is as easy as adding an action
to your Event. Read more about Groups <Link passHref href="/data-design/groups"><a>here</a></Link>.

## Updating Group Properties and linking users to Groups

A common way of handling group information is to link users with groups for all
subsequent calls. This often requires updating group properties. For instance this
might be when a new user gets added to a group (e.g. Team) and you would like to
update the member count of the team. Note that Segment will always link a user with
a Group when updating Group Properties.

Can probably mention that Segment does not support log event with group, that's
why Segment will always link a user with a Group when updating Group Properties.

**Step 1 - Add the Update Group action**

Go to the event which you wish to send the Group Properties with and choose the
`Update Group` action. This action allows you to link users with Groups and/or
update Group Properties.

**Step 2 - Add Groups and Group Properties**

To link users with Groups click `+ Add Group Type` and choose the Group Type you
wish to associate the user with. All subsequent calls will link the user to this
Group.

To update Group Properties click `+ Add Group Properties` to add as many properties
as you'd like from your groups. Avo will manage each separate call respectively.

## Logging Events with Groups

Sometimes it is useful to link only a given Event with a Group, especially when actions
of the user are not all related to the Group. You can associate a Group with an event by
clicking `+ Add Group` in the `Log Event` action and finding your appropriate value.

This is not supported by Segment.
