Avo is equipped with a familiar user interface to define and maintain Group Types and their properties and updating Group Properties is as easy as adding an action to your Event.

## Step 1 - Add the Update Group action

Go to the event which you wish to send the Group Properties with and choose the `Update Group` action. This action allows you to link users with Groups and/or update Group Properties.

## Step 2 - Add Groups and Group Properties

To link users with Groups click `+ Add Group Type` and choose the Group Type you wish to associate the user with. All subsequent calls will link the user to this Group.

To update Group Properties click `+ Add Group Properties` to add as many properties as you'd like from your groups. Avo will manage each separate call respectively. Note that Segment will always link a user with a Group when updating Group Properties.
