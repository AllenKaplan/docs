First thing you need to know is that tracking design happens on branches in Avo. When a new feature is built, the tracking plan manager opens a branch in Avo and plans all the new tracking there.
This allows us to show you the diff - what should be implemented for a specific feature.

To see the diff press the "View changes" panel in the sidebar.

### Sources

All the changes are grouped by sources, so you can pick the source you work on and ignore other sources, since they usually are separate codebases.  
If you have multiple sources in your codebase you can pick multiple sources.  

### Events

Below sources we see events. Since implementation is happening on the events level all changes on a single source are represented as event changes.  
There are 3 categories of events in the diff: New, Removed and Updated, so you can easily understand what kind of implementation is required.  
Every event has description and a link to Avo.  

### Properties

Then each event in the diff has a list of properties. Properties can be: new, removed, updated and existing.  
If the event is new, then all properties are new. If the event is removed then you don’t need to care about the properties. If the event is updated, then you’d change the updated properties, delete the removed props and keep the existing.  
Each property includes a description from Avo.  

### Destinations

Then we list the destinations of the event - new, removed and existing.

## What's next?

Next feature we recommend to explore is setting up <Link passHref href="/implementation/avo-tracking-plan-webhook"><a>the webhook</a></Link> that's triggered when a branch is merged.
