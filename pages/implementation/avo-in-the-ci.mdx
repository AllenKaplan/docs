You can add the `avo status` CLI command to your CI/CD workflows to regression check your tracking plan implementation.

The `avo status` command errors if no tracking call is found for any of the events defined in the Tracking Plan pinned in `avo.json`. It can be added to a your CI to make sure you always complete implementing all events, and to spot if tracking implementation is accidentally removed.

Currently the `avo status` command works as following:
- It validates tracking calls implemented with Avo Function (the Avo generated code)
- It will error if no instance of the event is found in your code. This means two things:
  1. It will not error if one tracking call instance is removed for a specific event, but there are still some tracking calls for this event remaining
  2. It will not error if the tracking call remains in a dead code path

### Set up Avo status in GitHub actions

Add this GitHub Actions script to `.github/workflows/avo_status.yml`.
It will take care of installing the Avo CLI and running the `avo status` check on your codebase every time new changes are pushed.

```sh
name: Avo Status
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Install Avo CLI
        run: npm install -g avo

      - name: Avo status
        run: yarn lint
```
