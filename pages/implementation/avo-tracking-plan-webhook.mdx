After setting up Webhook integration in <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/publishing"><a>Tracking Plan Publishing</a></Link>, your endpoint provided there will be called with a JSON
Schema payload representing the recent snapshot of your tracking plan when your tracking plan is published.

You can examine and download the exact JSON in the Publishing tab of your [Avo workspace](https://www.avo.app/schemas/).

<Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/publishing#tracking-plan-model">
  <a>The format is documented here</a>

, an example payload is:
