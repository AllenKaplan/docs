import Link from '../../components/Link';

After setting up Webhook integration in <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/publishing"><a>Tracking Plan Publishing</a></Link>, your endpoint provided there will be called with a [JSON
Schema](https://json-schema.org) payload representing the recent snapshot of your tracking plan when your tracking plan is published.

You can examine and download the exact JSON in the Publishing tab of your [Avo workspace](https://www.avo.app/schemas/).

The format is similar to:

```JSON
{
  "name": "Avo",
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "Debugger Started",
      "description": "Sent when the web debugger is started.",
      "rules": {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "required": [
          "properties"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "properties": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "Frame Location": {
                "description": "Describes from where the debugger was started.",
                "type": "string"
              },
              "Schema Id": {
                "description": "The ID of the schema that this event is related to.",
                "type": "string"
              },
              "Client": {
                "description": "",
                "type": "string",

                  "React Native Debugger (ios)",
                  "React Native Debugger (android)"
                ]
              },
              "Version": {
                "description": "The client version that the user is on. This is the same version for web and desktop.",
                "type": "string"
              }
            },
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "required": [
              "Schema Id",
              "Client",
              "Version"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
