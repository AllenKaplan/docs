After setting up Webhook integration in `Tracking Plan` - `Publishing` every time this integration is published your endpoint provided there will be called with a [JSON
Schema](https://json-schema.org) payload representing the recent snapshot of your tracking plan.

You can examine and download the exact JSON there.

The format is similar to:

```JSON

  "events": [
    {
      "name": "Debugger Started",
      "description": "Sent when the web debugger is started.",

        ],
        "properties": {
