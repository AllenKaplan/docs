### Platforms

Avo can code generate Avo Functions in Ruby for your server side tracking.

### Quickstart

Avo functions usage consists of 4 steps.

[//]: # (TODO For future: Here we can add link to the "Type safe code & unit tests" docs section when that's ready, something like:)
[//]: # 'TODO Learn more about how Avo Functions can help decrease time spent on implementing analytics and increase data reliability in this guide.'

#### Step 1. Include the Avo file

##### Pull the generated code with the Avo CLI

To get the Avo generated Ruby file you must be a member of an Avo workspace with a Ruby source. Ask for an invite from a colleague or create a <a href="https://avo.app/onboarding" target="_blank">new workspace</a>

```bash
$ npm install -g avo
$ avo login
$ avo pull --branch my-branch-name
```

Learn more about <Link passHref href="/implementation/cli"><a>the CLI here</a></Link>.

You can also <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/download-or-copy-avo-file-manually"><a>download the file manually</a></Link> from your Avo workspace.

#### Step 2. Initialize Avo

Import Avo from the generated file and initialize it by calling the `init_avo` method before tracking

```ruby
require './avo.rb'

Avo.init_avo(options: { env: :dev }, [system_properties], [custom_destination])
```

The actual parameters depend on your tracking plan setup, see the parameters explanation in <Link passHref href="/implementation/reference/python#init_avo"><a>the reference below</a></Link>.

#### Step 3. Call Avo functions to track your product usage

Every event in your tracking plan, marked with the "Implement with Avo" checkbox, gets a function in the generated code, named according to the event name, in snake_case.

[//]: # 'TODO Future: Add link here to the "Implement with Avo" doc in "Tracking Plan Management"'

For example, if you have a "Signup Start" event defined like this in Avo:

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    style={{ height: 600 + 'px' }}
    src={require('../../../images/signup-start-ui.png')}
    alt="Event 'Signup Start' defined in Avo with referral string property and implement with Avo check"
  />
</center>

You'll be able to call it like this from the generated code

```ruby
Avo.signup_start(referral: 'direct')
```

> Notice, that you are not passing the System property with the call. System properties are defined on the init step and then automatically included with all events.
> You can update the system properties with `set_system_properties` function.

#### Step 4. Verify the implementation

Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/implementation-status"><a>Implementation status</a></Link> in your Avo workspace to verify that your implementation is correct.

### Reference

#### init_avo

```ruby
def self.init_avo(options:, [system_properties:], [custom_dest:], [logger: nil])
```

Initializes Avo, needs to be called before the tracking methods. This method will call the `make(env:)` callback in the provided custom destinations.

##### Arguments

`options (Hash)`: a hash with :env symbol (:prod, :dev), :verbose (true, false)

`system_properties (Hash)`: a Hash containing the system properties that should be sent with every event.
When you define system properties in your Avo workspace you set name and type - the keys in this hash should be the same as system properties, in snake_case, and you should provide corresponding types, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any.

`[custom_dest (object)]`: if you have set up a custom destination for this source, an object with callbacks for the custom destination.

Custom destination object format:

```ruby
class CustomDestination
  def make(**args); end

  def track_event(**args); end

  def set_user_properties(**args); end
end

```

Read more about custom destinations <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-custom-destination"><a>here</a></Link>.

[//]: # 'TODO: Find examples of Ruby custom destinations for each analytics destination in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations"><a>this section</a></Link>.'

#### set_system_properties

```ruby
def self.set_system_properties(system_props)
```

A method to update system properties.

##### Arguments

`system_props (Hash)`: a Hash containing the system properties that should be sent with every event.
When you define system properties in your Avo workspace you set name and type - the keys in this dictionary should be the same as system properties, in snake_case, and you should provide corresponding types.

#### Event tracking functions

```ruby
def self.[your_event_name]([event_property_0:], [event_property_1:], ..., [user_property_0:], [user_property_1:], ..., [user_Id:], [anonymous_id:] })
```

Every event you define in your tracking plan in Avo gets a function named after the event in snake_case. The arguments of the function depend on how it's defined in your tracking plan.

##### Arguments

`event_property`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any. The argument key is snake_case version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
This is an event property that should be tracked with given event. Pass the value of the property to track here.

`user_property`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any. The argument key is snake_case version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
This is a user property that should be updated with given event. Pass the value of the property to update here.

`user_id`: string
added to all events, used to connect event to specific user, you have to either provide it or the `anonymous_id`

`anonymous_id`: string, this argument is automatically added, used to track anonymous users
