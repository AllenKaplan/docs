### Platforms

Avo can code generate Avo Functions in TypeScript targeted at the following platforms

- Web
- React Native
- Node.js

### Quickstart

Avo functions usage consists of 4 steps.

[//]: # (TODO For future: Here we can add link to the "Type safe code & unit tests" docs section when that's ready, something like:)
[//]: # 'TODO Learn more about how Avo Functions can help decrease time spent on implementing analytics and increase data reliability in this guide.'

#### Step 1. Include the Avo file

##### Pull the generated code with the Avo CLI

To get the Avo generated TypeScript file you must be a member of an Avo workspace with a TypeScript source. Ask for an invite from a colleague or create a <a href="https://avo.app/onboarding" target="_blank">new workspace</a>

```bash
$ npm install -g avo
$ avo login
$ avo pull --branch my-branch-name
```

Learn more about <Link passHref href="/implementation/cli"><a>the CLI here</a></Link>.

You can also <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/download-or-copy-avo-file-manually"><a>download the file manually</a></Link> from your Avo workspace.

#### Step 2. Initialize Avo

Import Avo from the generated file and initialize it by calling the `initAvo` method before tracking

```typescript
import Avo from './Avo';

Avo.initAvo(
  { env: Avo.AvoEnv.Dev },
  [systemProperties],
  [destinationOptions],
  [customDestination],
);
```

The actual parameters depend on your tracking plan setup, see the parameters explanation in <Link passHref href="/implementation/reference/typescript#initavo"><a>the reference below</a></Link>.

#### Step 3. Call Avo functions to track your product usage

Every event in your tracking plan, marked with the "Implement with Avo" checkbox, gets a function in the generated code, named according to the event name, in camelCase.

[//]: # 'TODO Future: Add link here to the "Implement with Avo" doc in "Tracking Plan Management"'

For example, if you have a "Signup Start" event defined like this in Avo:

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    style={{ height: 600 + 'px' }}
    src={require('../../../images/signup-start-ui.png')}
    alt="Event 'Signup Start' defined in Avo with referral string property and implement with Avo check"
  />
</center>

You'll be able to call it like this from the generated code

```typescript
Avo.signupStart({ referral: 'direct' });
```

> Notice, that you are not passing the System property with the call. System properties are defined on the init step and then automatically included with all events.
> You can update the system properties with `setSystemProperties` function.

#### Step 4. Verify the implementation

Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/implementation-status"><a>Implementation status</a></Link> in your Avo workspace and the <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/start-using-visual-debuggers"><a>visual debuggers</a></Link> to verify that your implementation is correct.

### Reference

#### initAvo

```typescript
Avo.initAvo(
  options: {
    env: AvoEnv;
    [webDebugger?: boolean];
    [strict?: boolean];
    [noop?: boolean];
    [reportFailureAs?: 'error' | 'warn' | 'log'];
    [inspector?: AvoInspector];
    [avoLogger?: AvoLogger];
  },
  [systemProperties: {
    systemProperty0: number;
    systemProperty1: boolean;
    ...}],
  [destinationOptions: any],
  [CustomDestDestination: CustomDestination])
```

Initializes Avo, needs to be called before the tracking methods. This method will initialize the SDKs for all destinations that are managed by Avo, and call the `make(env)` callback in the provided custom destinations.

##### Arguments

`options`: `{env, [noop], [strict], [avoLogger], [inspector], [mobileDebugger]}`

- `env`: AvoEnv, can be set to dev, prod and staging.
- `[webDebugger]: optional bool, for optional Avo Web Debugger instance
- `[strict = true]`: bool defaulting to true, if true, Avo will throw an exception when it detects a tracking problem in development or staging. Note that the strict flag is ignored in production.
- `[noop = false]`: bool defaulting to false, if true, Avo won't make any network calls (no tracking) in development and staging environments. Note that the noop flag is ignored in production.
- `[reportFailureAs]: optional, can be set to error, warn and log. Decides the log level of reports for failures.
- `[inspector]`: optional Avo Inspector instance. If you use Avo Inspector pass it here to make the Avo functions automatically report the invocations to the Avo Inspector.
- `[avoLogger]`: optional custom implementation of the logger. Can be used to disable logs. <Link passHref href="/implementation/custom-loggers#typescript"><a>Find the code snippet here</a></Link>.

`systemProperties`: an object where each field represents a system property in your tracking plan.
When you define system properties in your Avo workspace you set name and type - the fields of this object are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and you should provide corresponding types, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any.

`destinationOptions`: `{[segmentDestinationName], [anotherSegmentDestinationName], [amplitudeDestinationName], [mixpanelDestinationName]}`. Keys of this objects are the camelCase versions of your destinations in the Avo UI.

- `mixpanelDestinationName`: optional object, if you use Mixpanel destination managed by Avo, this object will be passed to `mixpanel.init(apiKey, options)` as the second parameter, `options`
- `amplitudeDestinationName`: optional object, if you use Amplitude destination managed by Avo, this object will be passed to `amplitude.init(apiKey, null, options)` as the third parameter, `options`
- `segmentDestinationName`: optional object, if you use Segment destination managed by Avo, this object will be passed to `analytics.load(apiKey, options)` as the second parameter, `options`

`customDestination`: CustomDestination, required if given source has a custom destination set up in Avo. Otherwise ignored.

Custom destination interface format:

```typescript
{
  make?: function (env: AvoEnv): void,
  logEvent?: function (eventName: string, eventProperties): void,
  setUserProperties?: function (userId: string, userProperties): void,
  identify?: function (userId: string): void,
  unidentify?: function (): void,
  logPage?: function (pageName: string, eventProperties): void
};
```

[//]: # 'TODO: Find examples of TypeScript custom destinations for each analytics destination in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations"><a>this section</a></Link>.'

#### setAvoLogger

```typescript
Avo.setAvoLogger(avoLogger);
```

This method allows you to provide custom implementation of the logger used by the Avo Functions, same as the `avoLogger` parameter in the `initAvo` call.
Can for example be used to disable logs or change which logging method is used.

##### Arguments

`avoLogger`: custom implementation of the logger. <Link passHref href="/implementation/custom-loggers#typescript"><a>Find the code snippet here</a></Link>.

#### setSystemProperties

```typescript
Avo.setSystemProperties(systemProperties);
```

A method to update system properties. If you provide undefined values here corresponding properties won't be updated

##### Arguments

`systemProperties`: an object where each field represents a system property in your tracking plan.
When you define system properties in your Avo workspace you set name and type - the fields of this object are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and you should provide corresponding types.

#### Event tracking functions

```typescript
Avo.yourEventName(properties: { [eventProperty0], [eventProperty1], ..., [userProperty0], [userProperty1], ..., [groupType0GroupId], [groupType1GroupId], ..., [groupProperty0], [groupProperty1], ..., [userId_], [anonymousId_], [segmentContext_] })
```

Every event you define in your tracking plan in Avo gets a function named after the event in camelCase. The arguments of the function depend on how it's defined in your tracking plan

##### Arguments

`eventProperty`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any.
Every event property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument.
The argument key is camelCase version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
Pass the value of the property to track here.

`userProperty`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any.
Every user property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument.
The argument key is camelCase version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
Pass the value of the property to update here.

`groupTypeGroupId`: string, if this event has group type attached in the UI, you'll provide the group id here.
The argument key is camelCase version of the group type defined in the Avo UI with the "GroupId" suffix.
E.g. if the event has "company" group type, the property will be celled "companyGroupId" and you would provide the company name.

`groupProperty`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, array, object and any.
Every group property attached to the event in the Avo UI with the "Group Update" action gets a corresponding argument.
The argument key is camelCase version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
Pass the value of the property to update here.

`userId_`: string, used to connect event to specific user
Web and React Native: Added if the event has the `Identify User` action
Node.js: added to all events, you have to either provide it or the `anonymousId_`

###### Additional arguments

`anonymousId_`: string, Node.js only, this argument is automatically added if corresponding setting is enabled, used to track anonymous users

`segmentContext_`: object, Node.js only, passed down to Segment as the Segment context, e.g. `segment.track({..., context: context})`
