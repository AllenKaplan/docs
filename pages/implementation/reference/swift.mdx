### Platforms

Avo can generate Swift code targeted at the following platforms

- iOS
- macOS

### Quickstart

Avo functions usage consists of 4 steps.

[//]: # (TODO For future: Here we can add link to the "Type safe code & unit tests" docs section when that's ready, something like:)
[//]: # 'TODO Learn more about how Avo Functions can help decrease time spent on implementing analytics and increase data reliability in this guide.'

#### Step 1. Include the Avo file

##### Pull the generated code with the Avo CLI

To get the Avo generated Kotlin file you must be a member of an Avo workspace with a Kotlin source. Ask for an invite from a colleague or create a <a href="https://avo.app/onboarding" target="_blank">new workspace</a>

```bash
$ npm install -g avo
$ avo login
$ avo pull --branch my-branch-name
```

Learn more about <Link passHref href="/implementation/cli"><a>the CLI here</a></Link>.

You can also <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/download-or-copy-avo-file-manually"><a>download the file manually</a></Link> from your Avo workspace.

#### Step 2. Initialize Avo

Initialize Avo by creating an object using constructor from the generated Avo file

```swift
val avo = Avo(env: .dev/*, other parameters depending on your tracking plan setup*/)
```

The actual parameters depend on your tracking plan setup, see the parameters explanation in <Link passHref href="/implementation/reference/swift#constructor"><a>the reference below</a></Link>.

#### Step 3. Call Avo functions to track your product usage

Every event in your tracking plan, marked with the "Implement with Avo" checkbox, gets a function in the generated code, named according to the event name, in camelCase.

[//]: # 'TODO Future: Add link here to the "Implement with Avo" doc in "Tracking Plan Management"'

For example, if you have a "Signup Start" event defined like this in Avo:

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    style={{ height: 600 + 'px' }}
    src={require('../../../images/signup-start-ui.png')}
    alt="Event 'Signup Start' defined in Avo with referral string property and implement with Avo check"
  />
</center>

You'll be able to call it like this from the generated code

```swift
avo.signupStart(referral: "direct")
```

> Notice, that you are not passing the System property with the call. System properties are defined on the init step and then automatically included with all events.
> You can update the system properties with `setSystemProperties` function.

#### Step 4. Verify the implementation

Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/implementation-status"><a>Implementation status</a></Link> in your Avo workspace and the <Link passHref href="/implementation/inspector/sdk/android"><a>Avo Inspector</a></Link> to verify that your implementation is correct.

### Reference

#### Constructor

```swift
init(env: AvoEnv,
    systemProprty0: Int, systemProperty1: Bool,
    customDestDestination: AvoCustomDestination,
    strict: Bool, noop: Bool);
```

Creates the Avo object that will be used to track. This method will initialize the SDKs for all destinations that are managed by Avo, and call the `make(env)` callback in all provided custom destinations.

##### Arguments

`env: AvoEnv`: Can be set to dev, prod and staging.

`systemProperties`: a number of parameters equal to the number of system properties defined in your Avo workspace.
The parameters are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and require corresponding types: string, int, long, float, bool, list, object or any.

`customDestination: AvoCustomDestination`: object, required if target source has a custom destination set up in Avo. Otherwise not present.

Custom destination protocol format:

```swift
public protocol AvoCustomDestination {
    func make(env: AvoEnv)
    func logEvent(eventName: String, eventProperties: [String:Any])
    func setUserProperties(userId: String, userProperties: [String:Any])
    func identify(userId: String)
    func unidentify()
}
```

Read more about custom destinations <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-custom-destination"><a>here</a></Link>.

[//]: # 'TODO Find examples of Swift custom destinations for each analytics destination in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations"><a>this section</a></Link>.'

`strict: Bool`: optional bool, if set, Avo will throw an exception when it detects a tracking problem in development or staging. Note that the strict flag is ignored in production.

`noop: Bool`: optional bool, if set, Avo won't make any network calls (no tracking) in development and staging environments. Note that the noop flag is ignored in production.

> Note that you do not need to pass the Avo Inspector instance to the constructor. It will be automatically picked up if you include the library and enable Avo Inspector for your iOS source in the Avo workspace. <Link passHref href=Link passHref href="/implementation/start-using-inspector-with-avo-functions"><a>Read more here</a></Link>.

#### avoLogger

```swift
avo?.avoLogger = MyAvoLogger()
```

where `MyAvoLogger` conforms to a protocol

```swift
public protocol AvoLogger {
    func logDebug(env: AvoEnv, message: String) -> Bool
    func logWarn(env: AvoEnv, message: String) -> Bool
    func logError(env: AvoEnv, message: String) -> Bool
}
```

Allows you to provide custom implementation of the logger used by the Avo Functions.
Can for example be used to disable logs or change which logging method is used.

  <a>Find the code snippet here</a>
</Link>
.

#### setSystemProperties

```swift
avo.setSystemProperties(systemProprty0: Int, systemProperty1: Bool?, ...)
```

A method to update system properties after initialization.

##### Arguments

`systemProperties`: a number of parameters equal to the number of system properties defined in your Avo workspace.
The parameters are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and require corresponding types: string, int, long, float, bool, list, object or any.

#### Event tracking functions

```swift
avo.yourEventName(eventProperty0: Int, eventProperty1: Double?, ..., userProperty0: Bool?, userProperty1: [Int], ..., userId_: String)
```

Every event you define in your tracking plan in Avo gets a function named after the event in camelCase. The arguments of the function depend on how it's defined in your tracking plan

##### Arguments

`eventProperty: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, list, object and any`:
Every event property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument. The argument key is camelCase version of the property name.
Pass the value of the property to track here.

`userProperty: type defined in the Avo tracking plan as a user property, can be string, int, long, float, bool, list, object and any`:
Every user property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument. The argument key is camelCase version of the property name.
Pass the value of the property to update here.

`userId_: String`:
Added if the event has the `Identify User` action
