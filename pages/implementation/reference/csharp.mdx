### Platforms

Avo can code generate Avo Functions in C# targeted at the following platforms

- .NET Server
- Unity

#### Step 1. Include the Avo file

##### Pull the generated code with the Avo CLI

To get the Avo generated C# file you must be a member of an Avo workspace with a C# source. Ask for an invite from a colleague or create a <a href="https://avo.app/onboarding" target="_blank">new workspace</a>

```bash
$ npm install -g avo
$ avo login
$ avo pull --branch my-branch-name
```

Learn more about <Link passHref href="/implementation/cli"><a>the CLI here</a></Link>.

You can also <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/download-or-copy-avo-file-manually"><a>download the file manually</a></Link> from your Avo workspace.

#### Step 2. Initialize Avo

Initialize Avo by creating an object using constructor from the generated Avo file

```csharp
using Avo;

Avo.Avo avo = new Avo.Avo(Avo.AvoEnv.Dev/*, other parameters depending on your tracking plan setup*/);
```

The actual parameters depend on your tracking plan setup, see the parameters explanation in <Link passHref href="/implementation/reference/csharp#constructor"><a>the reference below</a></Link>.

#### Step 3. Call Avo functions to track your product usage

Every event in your tracking plan, marked with the "Implement with Avo" checkbox, gets a function in the generated code, named according to the event name, in PasclaCase.

[//]: # 'TODO Future: Add link here to the "Implement with Avo" doc in "Tracking Plan Management"'

For example, if you have a "Signup Start" event defined like this in Avo:

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    style={{ height: 600 + 'px' }}
    src={require('../../../images/signup-start-ui.png')}
    alt="Event 'Signup Start' defined in Avo with referral string property and implement with Avo check"
  />
</center>

You'll be able to call it like this from the generated code

```csharp
avo.SignupStart(referral = "direct")
```

> Notice, that you are not passing the System property with the call. System properties are defined on the init step and then automatically included with all events.
> You can update the system properties with `setSystemProperties` function.

#### Step 4. Verify the implementation

Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/implementation-status"><a>Implementation status</a></Link> in your Avo workspace to verify that your implementation is correct.

### Reference

#### Constructor

```csharp
public Avo(AvoEnv env,
    // Other parameters may not be present, depending on your tracking plan
    int systemProperty0, bool systemProperty1,
    IDestination customDestination,
    bool strict = true
)
```

Creates the Avo object that will be used to track. This method will initialize the SDKs for all destinations that are managed by Avo, and call the `Make(env)` callback in all custom destinations.

##### Arguments

`AvoEnv env`: Can be set to dev, prod and staging.

`systemProperties`: a number of parameters equal to the number of system properties defined in your Avo workspace.
The parameters are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and require corresponding types: string, int, long, float, bool, list, object or any.

`IDestination customDestination`: object, required if target source has a custom destination set up in Avo. Otherwise not present.

Custom destination interface format:

```csharp
interface ICustomDestination {
    void Make(AvoEnv env);

    void LogEvent(string eventName, IDictionary<string, object> eventProperties);

    void SetUserProperties(string userId, IDictionary<string, object> userProperties);

    void Identify(string userId);

    void Unidentify();
}
```

Read more about custom destinations <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-custom-destination"><a>here</a></Link>.

[//]: # 'TODO Find examples of C# custom destinations for each analytics destination in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations"><a>this section</a></Link>.'

`strict: Boolean`: bool, if true, Avo will throw an exception when it detects a tracking problem in development or staging. Note that the strict flag is ignored in production.

#### setAvoLogger

```csharp
public static ILogger __LOGGER__ = null;
```

This filed allows you to provide custom implementation of the logger used by the Avo Functions.
Can for example be used to disable logs or change which logging method is used.

##### Arguments

`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger __LOGGER__`: custom implementation of the logger.

#### setSystemProperties

```csharp
 public void SetSystemProperties(int systemProperty0, bool systemProperty1, ...)
```

A method to update system properties after initialization.

##### Arguments

`systemProperties`: a number of parameters equal to the number of system properties defined in your Avo workspace.
The parameters are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and require corresponding types: string, int, long, float, bool, list, object or any.

#### Event tracking functions

```csharp
public void [YourEventName](int eventProperty0, double? eventProperty1, ..., bool? userProperty0, IList<int> userProperty1, ..., string userId_, string anonymousId_)
```

Every event you define in your tracking plan in Avo gets a function named after the event in PascalCase. The arguments of the function depend on how it's defined in your tracking plan

##### Arguments

`eventProperty: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool, list, object and any`:
Every event property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument. The argument key is camelCase version of the property name.
Pass the value of the property to track here.

`userProperty: type defined in the Avo tracking plan as a user property, can be string, int, long, float, bool, list, object and any`:
Every user property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument. The argument key is camelCase version of the property name.
Pass the value of the property to update here.

`userId_: String`: used to connect event to specific user.
Unity: Added if the event has the `Identify User` action
.NET: added to all events, you have to either provide it or the `anonymousId_`

###### Additional arguments

`anonymousId_`: string, .NET only, this argument is automatically added if corresponding setting is enabled, used to track anonymous users
