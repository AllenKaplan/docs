### Platforms

Avo can code generate Avo Functions in ReasonML targeted at the following platforms

- Web
- React Native
- Node.js

### Quickstart

Avo functions usage consists of 4 steps.

[//]: # (TODO For future: Here we can add link to the "Type safe code & unit tests" docs section when that's ready, something like:)
[//]: # 'TODO Learn more about how Avo Functions can help decrease time spent on implementing analytics and increase data reliability in this guide.'

#### Step 1. Include the Avo file

##### Pull the generated code with the Avo CLI

To get the Avo generated ReasonML file you must be a member of an Avo workspace with a ReasonML source. Ask for an invite from a colleague or create a <a href="https://avo.app/onboarding" target="_blank">new workspace</a>

```bash
$ npm install -g avo
$ avo login
$ avo pull --branch my-branch-name
```

Learn more about <Link passHref href="/implementation/cli"><a>the CLI here</a></Link>.

You can also <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/download-or-copy-avo-file-manually"><a>download the file manually</a></Link> from your Avo workspace.

#### Step 2. Initialize Avo

Import Avo from the generated file and initialize it by calling the `initAvo` method before tracking

```reasonml
Avo.initAvo(
  ~env=`dev,
  ~systemProperties=Avo.AvoSystemProperties.t(),
  [~destinationOptions=?],
  [~customDestination=?],
  ()
);
```

The actual parameters depend on your tracking plan setup, see the parameters explanation in <Link passHref href="/implementation/reference/reasonml#initavo"><a>the reference below</a></Link>.

#### Step 3. Call Avo functions to track your product usage

Every event in your tracking plan, marked with the "Implement with Avo" checkbox, gets a function in the generated code, named according to the event name, in camelCase.

[//]: # 'TODO Future: Add link here to the "Implement with Avo" doc in "Tracking Plan Management"'

For example, if you have a "Signup Start" event defined like this in Avo:

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    style={{ height: 600 + 'px' }}
    src={require('../../../images/signup-start-ui.png')}
    alt="Event 'Signup Start' defined in Avo with referral string property and implement with Avo check"
  />
</center>

You'll be able to call it like this from the generated code

```reasonml
Avo.signupStart(~referral="direct");
```

> Notice, that you are not passing the System property with the call. System properties are defined on the init step and then automatically included with all events.
> You can update the system properties with `setSystemProperties` function.

#### Step 4. Verify the implementation

Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/implementation-status"><a>Implementation status</a></Link> in your Avo workspace and the <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/start-using-visual-debuggers"><a>visual debuggers</a></Link> to verify that your implementation is correct.

### Reference

#### initAvo

```reasonml
Avo.initAvo(
      ~env: AvoEnv,
      ~systemProperties: AvoSystemProperties.t,
      ~webDebugger: bool=true,
      ~noop: bool=false,
      [~mobileDebugger: option(mobileDebuggerInstance)=?],
      [~destinationOptions: option(DestinationOptions.t())=?],
      [~customDestination: avoCustomDestination],
      (): unit,
)
```

Initializes Avo, needs to be called before the tracking methods. This method will initialize the SDKs for all destinations that are managed by Avo, and call the `make(env)` callback in the provided custom destinations.

##### Arguments

- `env`: AvoEnv, can be set to dev, prod and staging.
- `systemProperties`: AvoSystemProperties.t, where each field represents a system property in your tracking plan.
  When you define system properties in your Avo workspace you set name and type - the fields of this object are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and you should provide corresponding types, can be string, int, long, float, bool and list.
- `webDebugger`: optional bool, for optional Avo Web Debugger instance
- `[noop=false]`: optional bool, if set, Avo won't make any network calls (no tracking) in development and staging environments. Note that the noop flag is ignored in production.
- `[mobileDebugger]`: React Native specific and optional Avo Debugger instance. Pass it to make the Avo functions automatically show the functions calls and all the errors in the visual debugger. Check <a target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/avohq/react-native-analytics-debugger">React Native mobile debugger repo</a> to learn more about it.

`destinationOptions`: `[~segmentDestinationName=?], [~anotherSegmentDestinationName=?], [~amplitudeDestinationName=?], [~mixpanelDestinationName=?]`. Keys of this object are the camelCase versions of your destinations in the Avo UI.

- `mixpanelDestinationName`: optional Js.t, if you use Mixpanel destination managed by Avo, this object will be passed to `mixpanel.init(apiKey, options)` as the second parameter, `options`
- `amplitudeDestinationName`: optional Js.t, if you use Amplitude destination managed by Avo, this object will be passed to `amplitude.init(apiKey, null, options)` as the third parameter, `options`
- `segmentDestinationName`: optional Js.t, if you use Segment destination managed by Avo, this object will be passed to `analytics.load(apiKey, options)` as the second parameter, `options`

`customDestination`: CustomDestination, required if given source has a custom destination set up in Avo. Otherwise not included.

Custom destination interface format:

```reasonml
{
  make: (env: avoEnvType) => unit,
  logEvent: (eventName: string, eventProperties: Js.Json.t) => unit,
  setUserProperties: (userId: string, userProperties: Js.Json.t) => unit,
  identify: (userId: string) => unit,
  unidentify: unit => unit,
};
```

[//]: # 'TODO: Find examples of ReasonML custom destinations for each analytics destination in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations"><a>this section</a></Link>.'

#### setSystemProperties

```reasonml
Avo.setSystemProperties([~systemProperty1=?], [~systemProperty2=?], ..., ());
```

A method to update system properties. If you don't provide values here corresponding properties won't be updated

##### Arguments

`systemProperties`: a record where each field represents a system property in your tracking plan.
When you define system properties in your Avo workspace you set name and type - the fields of this object are named the same as system properties, in camelCase, and you should provide corresponding types.

#### Event tracking functions

```reasonml
Avo.yourEventName([~eventProperty0], [~eventProperty1], ..., [~userProperty0], [~userProperty1], ..., [~userId_], [~anonymousId_], [~segmentContext_])
```

Every event you define in your tracking plan in Avo gets a function named after the event in camelCase. The arguments of the function depend on how it's defined in your tracking plan

##### Arguments

`eventProperty`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool and list.
Every event property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument.
The argument key is camelCase version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
Pass the value of the property to track here.

`userProperty`: type defined in the Avo tracking plan, can be string, int, long, float, bool and list.
Every user property attached to the event in the Avo UI gets a corresponding argument.
The argument key is camelCase version of the property name defined in the Avo UI.
Pass the value of the property to update here.

`userId_`: string, used to connect event to specific user
Web and React Native: Added if the event has the `Identify User` action
Node.js: added to all events, you have to either provide it or the `anonymousId_`

###### Additional arguments

`anonymousId_`: string, Node.js only, this argument is automatically added if corresponding setting is enabled, used to track anonymous users

`segmentContext_`: Js.t, Node.js only, passed down to Segment as the Segment context, e.g. `segment.track({..., context: context})`
