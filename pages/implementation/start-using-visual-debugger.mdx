When implementing analytics on web and mobile apps itâ€™s hard to know if the events are being sent successfully or not, and if they are being sent at the correct time.

Our **_Visual Debuggers_** provide a way to control the events flow in your app, making implementing analytics way easier and pleasant in web and mobile products.

Web Visual debugger is integrated into the Avo generated file and mobile debuggers are distributed as standalone open source libraries.

Each **_Avo_** function will automatically show events in the debugger with timestamp and all the properties.

If **_Avo_** detects errors the visual debugger will highlight those.

### Accessing the web debugger

The debuggers are on by default in development but can be accessed in production:

Web: add the avo_debug=1 query parameter to the URL

### Setting up the mobile debuggers

The following pseudocode would give you the idea, head to <a href="#platform-docs">platform docs</a> for specific integration instructions.

1. Create the debugger

```javascript
val debugger = Debugger()
```

2. Pass the debugger when you initialize Avo

```javascript
Avo.initAvo(Avo.AvoEnv.DEV, debugger)
```

3. Show the debugger

```javascript
debugger.showDebugger(this, DebuggerMode.bar)
```

4. Pass debugger to Avo, so Avo can show all tracked events

```javascript
Avo.initAvo(AvoEnv.DEV, myCustomDestination, debugger)
```

5. Post your own events

```javascript
debugger.post(
    timestamp,
    "EventName",
    errors: [{propertyId:"id0", message:"error in property 'event prop' with id 'id0'"}],
    eventProperties: [{id:"id0", name:"event prop", value:"val"}],
    userProperties: [{id:"id1", name:"user prop", value:"val"}]
);
```
