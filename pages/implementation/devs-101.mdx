Avo offers three validation types:

1.  <a href="#avo-functions-type-safe-analytics-wrappers">Avo Functions: Type safe analytics wrappers</a>
2.  <a href="#avo-inspector-tracking-observability">Avo Inspector: Tracking Observability</a>
3.  <a href="#avo-in-app-inspector-aka-avo-debuggers">Avo In-App Inspector: AKA Avo Debuggers</a>


## Avo Functions: Type safe analytics wrappers

### What are Avo Functions?

<Link passHref href="/implementation/avo-functions-overview"><a>Avo Functions</a></Link> are 
type safe analytics wrappers that are code generated based on your <Link passHref href="/workspace"><a>tracking plan</a></Link>. <br/> <br/> 

Technical or non-technical people can define analytics event schemas in the <Link passHref href="/workspace"><a>Avo Tracking Plan</a></Link>, 
and you can generate human readable type safe code based on that. The days of unstructured 
and outdated tracking plan spreadsheets and Jira tickets are over ðŸ¥³ So are the days of brittle 
analytics implementation you have to revisit to fix again and again and again ðŸ˜Œ

### How do Avo Functions work?

Avo Functions are type safe analytics wrappers that can wrap whatever analytics SDK you already 
use or plan on using, whether it's any of the out-of-the-box event logging SDKs (e.g. from 
Google Analytics 4, Segment, Rudderstack, mParticle, Snowplow, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Pendo, 
etc) or your home made SDK.

The Avo Functions have a <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations"><a>Destination Interface</a></Link> 
that you have full control over how you implement. You implement a simple Destination Interface 
object and pass it into initAvo, so that any time an Avo Function calls an analytics 
logging method (e.g. logEvent, setUserProperties, etc), you can govern exactly what analytics 
SDK method should be called.


In the <Link passHref href="/workspace"><a>Avo Tracking Plan</a></Link> you can govern which analytics SDK methods 
should be triggered with an Avo Function. For example you might want to update user properties or log revenue 
along with logging an event. In the Avo tracking plan you can configure those settings, and the Avo Functions 
will handle calling all the relevant analytics SDK methods. All you have to do is call the Avo Function in your 
code base and pass in type safe key-value pairs, and the Avo Function will take care of the rest.

## Avo Inspector: Tracking Observability

### What is Avo Inspector?

Avo Inspector is a tracking observability solution that's easy to install. Avo Inspector 
gives you an instant audit of your current state of tracking, and an ongoing observability 
going forward. 

### How does Avo Inspector work?

The Inspector API extracts the schemas (aka shapes) of the events you trigger (no PII data, 
only event names, property names, and types of properties) and sends those schemas to 
the Avo servers. To repeat: None of the PII data ever flows through Avo servers; only event schemas.

### How do I use Inspector?

You can view the overview of your current tracking in the 
<Link passHref href="/workspace/inspector"><a>Inspector dashboard</a></Link> 
and you can connect Avo Inspector to a Slack channel to receive alerts when the Inspector detects 
a new issue that has not been seen in production for 30 days.

### How do I send data into the Inspector?

You can send data into Inspector three ways:

1.  <a href="#inspector-sdks">Inspector SDKs</a>
2.  <a href="#connect-with-cdps-and-analytics-platforms">Connect with CDPs and analytics platforms</a>
1.  <a href="#inspector-api">Inspector API</a>


#### Inspector SDKs

The Inspector SDK can be plugged into your existing tracking â€“ independent of whether 
you're using the Avo Functions or not.

##### Inspector SDK with your existing tracking

The Inspector SDK is a stand-alone SDK which you can install with your package manager.
You can use the Inspector SDK whether or not you adopt Avo Functions, by plugging the 
Inspector SDK into the call site of your existing tracking. Most code bases 
have some sort of a wrapper around calling their analytics SDKs, and that's where you 
plug the Inspector SDK.

##### Inspector SDK with Avo Functions

Initialize the Avo Functions SDK with an instance of the Inspector SDK.

#### Connect with CDPs and analytics platforms

You can pipe your analytics data into the Inspector API via your CDPs or analytics providors:

- Segment: Set Inspector up via Segment Functions
- Mixpanel: Coming soon.
- mParticle: Coming soon.
- Rudderstack: Coming soon.

Reach out to support@avo.sh for early access to any of the platforms comping soon.

#### Inspector API

Coming soon: You can send data into the Inspector API directly. Reach out to support@avo.sh for early access.

### Does Inspector recieve PII data?

No. Inspector does not receive any PII data. Inspector only takes in event names, 
property names, and types of properties.


## Avo In-App Inspector: AKA Avo Debuggers

Avo provides an <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-using-visual-debugger"><a>In-App Inspector</a></Link> that shows you when you're triggering events, what the schemas are,
and whether they match the analytics event spec. The In-App Inspector is displayed via a small bubble 
on your web or mobile app, which you can click into and see the details of the event structure.

When you implement analytics via the <a href="#avo-functions-type-safe-analytics-wrappers">Avo Functions</a>, the In-App Inspector will not only show you 
the timing and schema of your event, but also display a red warning or green check mark based on 
whether or not your events fits the analytics spec in your Avo tracking plan.
