The use case of Avo for developers is twofold:

- Avo generated file, which is the type-safe code representation of your tracking plan, containing Avo Functions, allows you to implementing reliable tracking fast.

- Avo Inspector SDKs, allow you to plug in your existing tracking to Avo to analyze it and help you migrate to type-safe implementation.

Each can be used on its own, but together they unlock the full power of Avo.
