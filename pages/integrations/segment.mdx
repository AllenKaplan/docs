## Generate code to send data to Segment

You can use Avo Functions with Segment.

To do that either:

1. For full control, create a Custom destinations, name it "Segment", connect to your source and  generate the code.

Then, when you initialize Avo you'll see additional parameter in the initialization method, the custom destination object.

See the custom destination examples for different languages in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations/segment"><a>the Segment destination section</a></Link>.

2. Create a managed Segment destination, connect it to your source and generate the code for that source. Then Avo will take care of initializing Segment SDK and sending data to it.
