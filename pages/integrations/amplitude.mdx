## Generate code to send data to Amplitude

You can use Avo Functions with Amplitude.

To do that either:

1. For full control, create a custom destinations, name it "Amplitude", connect to your source and generate the code for that source.

Then, when you initialize Avo you'll see additional parameter in the initialization method, the custom destination object.

See the custom destination examples for different languages in <Link passHref href="/implementation/destinations/amplitude"><a>the Amplitude destination section</a></Link>.

2. Create a managed Amplitude destination, connect it to your source and generate the code for that source. Then Avo will take care of initializing Amplitude SDK and sending data to it.

## Send app data to Inspector with the SDK
