## <a name="does-avo-send-my-events-to-its-server"></a> Does Avo send my events to its servers?

No, never. Analytics wrappers generated by Avo only ever wrap your analytics SDK
or delivery mechanism to custom pipelines such that no data is ever sent to Avo
servers.

## <a name="why-api-keys"></a> Why does Avo want me to input my analytics tool API keys?

Avo tries it very best to ensure your analytics are consistent across platforms.
It's very common for teams to have multiple sources, such as Android, iOS and
Web, and to ensure that all of these sources are sending to the correct
destinations we ask users to input their API keys to Avo so our CLI tool can
generate correct code for each of those sources.

Note, these API keys are usually not considered secrets. For example, web
applications usually put these API keys directly in their `<head>` tag.

## <a name="custom-endpoint"></a> My team has its own custom endpoint for analytics, can we use Avo?

Yes, Avo supports custom destinations or custom pipelines as destinations.
