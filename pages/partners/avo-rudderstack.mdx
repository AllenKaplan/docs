## Why use both Avo and Rudderstack?

...

## How to get started

We recommend your first “full-circle” release in Avo be a small one. This will enable you to quickly go through your first analytics release in Avo, from start to finish.

**For example:** Don’t choose a product release that’s about to take the next 3 months to work on. Choose one that has a couple of new or updated events.

### **The Avo workflow**

- Plan analytics update in Avo branch

  - Docs: Quickstart: Branches

- Review suggestions in Avo

  - Connect to Slack for notifications into a Slack channel about new branches, comments or at-mentions
  - “View changes” screen where you can pull in stakeholders
  - Leverage Branch Audits.

- Share implementation instructions with developers via Avo

  - Add a link to your branch’s View Changes screen in internal tickets (e.g. Jira or Asana) and/or leverage auto-generated Implementation instructions

- Implement analytics events

  - Optionally: Leverage the Avo Codegen (aka Avo Functions)—but this is not a likely part of your initial release cycle.

- [maybe] Validate implementation using Avo

  - When you start leveraging Avo for release validation depends on when you get Inspector up (more on Inspector setup below).
  - The Avo workflow will still save you time even if Inspector is not up-and-running in your initial analytics releases with Avo.

- Merge Avo branch and Publish schema to downstream schema registries (more on Publishing below).
