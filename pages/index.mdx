Avo lets companies ship clean and functional product analytics, so they can make informed decisions that drive growth in three steps:

1. Design and review your metrics and events in the Avo app.
2. Implement the analytics from the Avo command line tool
3. Avo validates your events and delivers the data to your product analytics provider of choice.

Because your whole team has access to the same interface designing and verifying the data, you trust that the insights in your product analytics provider are correct. Developers love it because what’s been boilerplate and tedious work has been made error-proof for them so they can go back to building features instead of sweating over breaking their analytics every time they ship.

The Avo Analytics Governance Workflow is built to unlock the virtuous cycle of good analytics governance where anyone can access the insights they need and it’s easy to implement changes. Empower your team to understand what gets tracked, participate in the data design, and then line up the code and implement. Rinse, review and repeat!
