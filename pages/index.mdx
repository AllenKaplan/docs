We distinguish 3 levels of Avo adoption, you don't need to go all the way, because every stage has value in itself. 

> For example, if you already have a framework for analytics implementation and implementation data bugs is not a problem for you, you can stay at the second adoption stage.

## 1. Avo as the source of truth of your tracking plan - no-code solution

Use Avo instead of your spreadsheet to manage and discuss your tracking plan. Avo is designed for analytics, so it's way better than the spreadsheet for that use case.

This stage does not require any developer input, so you can adopt it in the data design team without getting developer buyin.

**Creating tracking plan in Avo**

|Data Managers|Developers|
--- | ---
|If you already have a tracking plan you can import it to Avo||
|- <Link passHref href="/tracking-plan/importing"><a>Import existing csv spreadsheet, Amplitude or Mixpanel tracking plan</a></Link>||
|Next step would be fine tuning it and adding new events for new features, or, if you don't have tracking plan yet, you can define it in Avo||
|- <Link passHref href="/data-design/start-data-design"><a>Design data in Avo</a></Link>||
|- //TODO Define sources and destinations for documentation||

**Branched workflows**

|Data Managers|Developers|

|One of the core features for effectiva data design in Avo is branched workflow. It allows you to see the changes for a single feature and provides implementation instructions that you can share with the developers working on the analytics implementation.||

**Publish tracking plan from Avo to other analytics tools**

You can set up your tracking plan to be automatically published to Segment Protocols, Amplitude and Mixpanel every time a branch is merged. We also provide a webhook for advanced automation.

## 2. Connect your tracking implementation with your Avo tracking plan
Add a lightweight SDK to your code to learn how actual implementation compares with the defined tracking plan. 
Get instant feedback on what tracking is implemented when working on new features with the Implementation status in your Avo workspace. 
Observe your tracking calls on device in real time with the Avo Debuggers.

This stage requires one time setup in each of your applications.
It is not necessary to to set up all platforms at once, can start with a single platform.
Once it's done the data design team will get the full power of Avo.

> Level 1 is required, but levels 2 and 3 are interchangable, i.e. you can go directly to level 3 without going through level 2 if you platform does not yet have the Inspector SDK and start using the Inspector once it's available.

## 3. Generate type safe analytics code from your tracking plan
Avo generates human readable code, called Avo functions, that sends the data exactly as planned. No more data bugs in your code, even between platforms!

This stage requires constant interaction with Avo from developers. 
It's not necessary to swap all your tracking with Avo functions, can start with a single tracking call.
It's not necessary to adopt Avo functions in all platforms at once, can start with a single platform.
