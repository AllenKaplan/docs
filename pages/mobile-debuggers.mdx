When implementing analytics on mobile apps itâ€™s hard to know if the events are being sent successfully or not, and if they are being sent at the correct time.

Our **_Mobile Debuggers_** provide a visual way to control the events flow in your app, making implementing analytics way easier and pleasant in mobile products.

They are distributed as a standalone open source libraries and are designed to be plugged in the **_Avo_** generated code. Each **_Avo_** function will automatically show events in the debugger with timestamp and all the properties.
If **_Avo_** detects errors the mobile debugger will highlight those.

Here is a demonstration of the mobile debugger in a simple music player app.

 </td>
</tr>
</table>

The debugger have 2 visual presentation modes - **_bubble_** and **_bar_**. Both are draggable, so you can place them at a suitable spot in your app.
You can switch between presentation mods without loosing the data.

**_Avo functions_** are triggered when player buttons are pressed and the events are shown in the **_Mobile Debugger_**. If an error event is registered the debugger will turn red.

When the **_Mobile Debugger_** is clicked another screen opens with the list of all the events. Each event can be collapsed or expended to see the properties and error descriptions.

> Source code of the app for each supported platform can be found in the git repositories.

## <a name="how-to-enable"></a> How to enable the debugger

The following pseudocode would give you the idea, head to <a href="#platform-docs">platform docs</a> for specific integration instructions.

1. Create the debugger

   `val debugger = Debugger()`

2. Pass the debugger when you initialize Avo

   `Avo.initAvo(Avo.AvoEnv.DEV, debugger)`

3. Show the debugger

```typescript
debugger.showDebugger(this, DebuggerMode.bar)
```

4. Pass debugger to Avo, so Avo can show all tracked events

```typescript
Avo.initAvo(AvoEnv.DEV, myCustomDestination, debugger)
```

5. Post your own events

```typescript
   debugger.post(
      timestamp,
      "EventName",
      errors: [{propertyId:"id0", message:"error in property 'event prop' with id 'id0'"}],
      eventProperties: [{id:"id0", name:"event prop", value:"val"}],
      userProperties: [{id:"id1", name:"user prop", value:"val"}]
   );
```
