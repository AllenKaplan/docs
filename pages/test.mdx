If you are already sending some analytics events from your product and are seeing some potential errors in the data and/or want better confidence in it, then we recommend that you contact us to get access to the **Avo Inspector** add-on.

**Avo Inspector** analyzes your current state of tracking and guides the way from your current messy taxonomy to more consistent and reliable tracking across teams, products, and platforms. <a to="/inspector">Read more about Avo Inspector in the documentation</a>.

Start monitoring the health of your tracking today with Avo Inspector â€“ email **support@avo.app** to get access!

### Getting started

If you relate to one or more of the following statments, we recommend using the custom generated tracking snippets to start sending analytics events without bugs.

- you team is looking for a callaborative tool to instrument your **new analytics events** in a reliable way
- your team is **not sending many or any analytics events yet** and are looking for a tool to start in an efficient way
- have some tracking that you are not very happy with and **want to start from scratch**

If any of these apply to you, then here are the steps to get started:

1. Sign up to Avo and create your [workspace](/workspace)
2. [Set up your tracking plan](/workspace/tracking-plan) by defining the structure of your analytics events
3. Generate the custome tracking snippets by [downloading them from your Avo workspace](/workspace/implement#avo-file) or using the <a to="/commands#quickstart">Avo CLI</a>
4. [Initialize Avo](/workspace/implement#init-avo)
5. [Implement your analytics events](/workspace/implement#implement-actions)
6. Enjoy error free product analytics!
