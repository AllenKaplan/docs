It’s time to start working on a new feature or improvement for your team and of course you want to measure the success of the change. In this guide you will find the recommended workflow from beginning to end for teams that have adopted Avo and are ready to use the tool in their routine feature work.

The steps described here are usually performed by different people with different roles within teams – all depending on the structure of your company and the responsibilities of the roles.

_Role: This initiative is often led by a product manager._

This is usually the hardest part, deciding on what events and properties you need to measure the success of the change you are about to make. There are many paths you can take to lead you to a decision, but no matter which one you take, we recommend doing it as early as possible. 

We always recommend starting with formulating the metrics that you hope to move with your change. Our favorite way to do that is what we like to call a (“Purpose Meeting”)[https://www.avo.app/blog/tracking-the-right-product-metrics]. The outcomes of that meeting are:
1. Goals – what does success look like?
2. Metrics – how will we measure how successful we are?
3. Data – what analytics events do we need for our success metrics?

The result of the purpose meeting is usually a draft of events that someone takes forward to the next step.
