# Multiple sources on Avo branches

For teams that have more than one platform, it often occurs that changes are made to the tracking plan for more than one Avo source at the same time.

We recommend creating one Avo branch that includes changes for all desired sources. When the changes has been implemented on one of the sources we recommend this workflow:

1. tag the events (for example `re-add sources`) included in the change
2. quickly remove the non-ready-source(s) from the event(s)
3. merge the branch
4. open another branch
5. filter events with the tag you just created
6. add the non-ready-source(s) again to the events
7. the implementing dev on the non-ready-source(s) updates the branch they are working on to be the new branch
